# Resolution Algorithm 
# Introduction
This Python program provides a resolution solver implemented with a graphical user interface using Tkinter. The solver utilizes the resolution algorithm to determine the validity of a logical formula provided by the user.
The resolution algorithm is a method used in propositional logic to determine whether a given formula is logically valid. It works by attempting to derive the empty clause (a contradiction) from a set of clauses representing the negated form of the formula. If such a derivation is successful, the original formula is considered valid; otherwise, it is invalid.
# Features
-Supports both English and French languages. 
-Validates logical formulas using the resolution method.
-Provides feedback on whether the formula is valid or invalid.
